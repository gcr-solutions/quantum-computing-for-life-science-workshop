# Quantum Computing For Life Science Solution

Quantum Computing For Life Science Solution is a cloud-native solution for the application of quantum computing
technology in different aspects of life science. This solution is trying to bridge the gap between the industrial
knowledge and the novel computation model provided by the quantum technologies. This solution will continually 
implement the Proof of Concepts (PoC) based on the recent publications or reports. It is suitable for customers
with needs to evaluate the possible useful cases of quantum computing in their industries. No matter you just
start to consider this new technology or on the way, you can use this solution to speed up the process, save
time and cost. It is an open-source projects, anyone can contribute to features of adding more related solutions.

Biology is one of the science categories that will be directly impacted by quantum. This technology will 
impact industry verticals such as drug discovery, genetic engineering.
Quantum computers represent a paradigm shift in computation. 
We are entering a fascinating period in the development of quantum computers. 
As this technology is still in such an early phase, it may be that its true impact is not even fully understood yet. 
This makes this field even more fascinating to follow.
