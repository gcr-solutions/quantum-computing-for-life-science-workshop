Drug discovery is a high-risk and time-consuming field. The average R&D cost required to bring a 
new, FDA approved medicine to patients is estimated to be $2.6 billion over the past decade 
(in 2013 dollars). This includes the cost of the many potential medicines that do not make 
it through to FDA approval. For example, in research for treatments for Alzheimer’s disease over the past 16 years, for example, only four new medicines have been approved for Alzheimer’s out of 123 treatment attempts that were tested in clinical studies. That’s a 3 percent approval rate.

This is also high-reward field., where a blockbuster therapy can deliver life-changing 
clinical benefits to millions of patients and generate billions of dollars in profit. 
Let's consider the case for Alzheimer's treatment. The new treatments approved by 2025 that delay 
the onset of Alzheimer’s by five years would reduce the number of people with the disease 
by approximately 40 percent and cost for care of patients by $367 billion a year by 2050.

Innovation and advancements in computer-aided drug design (CADD) helps increase the productivity in
drug research and development. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), such as 
Deepmind’s celebrated protein folding algorithm
[3], still rely on statistical models running on classical comput-
ers which are, for example, limited in modelling quantum
mechanical systems such as protein structures. However, hopes
for a literal quantum leap in research productivity lie in the
development of quantum computers (QC).
