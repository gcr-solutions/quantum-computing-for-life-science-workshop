Drug discovery is a high-risk and time-consuming field. The average R&D cost required to bring a 
new, FDA approved medicine to patients is estimated to be $2.6 billion over the past decade 
(in 2013 dollars). This includes the cost of the many potential medicines that do not make 
it through to FDA approval. For example, in research for treatments for Alzheimer’s disease over the past 16 years, for example, only four new medicines have been approved for Alzheimer’s out of 123 treatment attempts that were tested in clinical studies. That’s a 3 percent approval rate.

This is also high-reward field., where a blockbuster therapy can deliver life-changing 
clinical benefits to millions of patients and generate billions of dollars in profit. 
Let's consider the case for Alzheimer's treatment. The new treatments approved by 2025 that delay 
the onset of Alzheimer’s by five years would reduce the number of people with the disease 
by approximately 40 percent and cost for care of patients by $367 billion a year by 2050.

Innovation and advancements in computer-aided drug design (CADD) helps increase the productivity in
drug research and development. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) still rely on statistical 
models running on classical computers. These devices are limited in modelling quantum mechanical systems 
such as protein structures. However, hopes for a literal quantum leap in research productivity lie 
in the development of quantum computers.

Researchers have listed the quantum techniques that can be applied to the components in the general workflow
of drug discovery process. As the above image shown, both the structured-based methods and ligand-based methods
can be beneficial from the techniques in noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices and fault-tolerant 
quantum computing devices.
