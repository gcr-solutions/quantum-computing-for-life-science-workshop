1. If you get the following error in this sectionï¼š

    ```
    An error occurred (ResourceNotFoundException) when calling the UpdataFunctionConfiguration operation: Function not found: ... :rs-dev-workshop-SNSMessageLambda
    ```

    It proves that your Lambda created failed. Check if your Lambda service has `S3: CreateBucket` permission. If not, you need to create an S3 bucket first with the bucket name `aws-gcr-rs-sol-dev-workshop-${REGION}-${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}`.

2. If the heart status of some pods fails for a long time, as shown below:
   
    ![argocd heart unhealthy](/images/argocd-heart-unhealthy.png)

    It maybe because your redis configuration information setting failed. Open your Cloud9 control interface and click on the file `/manifest/envs/news-dev/config.yaml` on the left file bar. The content of the file should be as follows:

    ![fix redis bug](/images/redis-bug.png)

    If your redis_port or redis_host is empty, please open [link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/home), select Redis in the left bar, and select `gcr-rs-dev-workshop-redis-cluster`:

    ![redis console](/images/redis-console.png)

    Copy the content of **Primary Endpoint** to the config.yaml file according to the format of **redis_host:redis_port**, and enter the following command to update the configuration:

    ```shell
    cd /home/ec2-user/environment/recommender-system-dev-workshop-code/
    git pull
    git add ./manifests/envs/news-dev/config.yaml
    git commit -m "update config"
    git push
    ```
